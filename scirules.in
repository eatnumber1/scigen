SCI_ABSTRACT_HEADER <b>Abstract</b>
SCI_INTRO_HEADER <b>Introduction</b>

SCI_INTRO_A	Many SCI_PEOPLE would agree that, had it not been for TOPIC , the SCI_ACT might never have occurred.
SCI_INTRO_A	SCI_THING must work.
SCI_INTRO_A	In recent years, much research has been devoted to the SCI_ACT; however, few have explored the SCI_ACT.
SCI_INTRO_A	SCI_THING and SCI_THING, while SCI_ADJ in theory, have not until recently been considered SCI_ADJ.
SCI_INTRO_A	The SCI_ACT is a challenge.
SCI_INTRO_A	The SCI_ACT has SCI_VERBED SCI_THING, and current trends suggest that the SCI_ACT will soon emerge.
SCI_INTRO_A	SCI_PEOPLE agree that TOPIC is an interesting new topic in the field of SCI_FIELD, and SCI_PEOPLE concur.
SCI_INTRO_A	The SCI_FIELD approach to SCI_THING is defined not only by the SCI_ACT, but also by the SCI_ADJ need for SCI_THING.

LIT_A_ONE	FIRSTNAME LASTNAME was a LIT_ADJ_POS contributor to the LIT_PERIOD literary tradition.
LIT_A_ONE	Frequent allusions to LIT_THEMES have led many critics to question LASTNAME 's LIT_NOUN_POS .
LIT_A_ONE	There was no author more LIT_ADJ_POS during the LIT_PERIOD than FIRSTNAME LASTNAME .
LIT_A_ONE	Writers of the LIT_PERIOD LIT_DURATION ignored the themes of LIT_THEMES_A and LIT_THEMES_C . FIRSTNAME LASTNAME was no exception.
LIT_A_ONE	LIT_THEMES was a favorite theme of FIRSTNAME LASTNAME .
LIT_A_TWO	However, in  LIT_BOOK , LASTNAME demonstrates none of the ill effects that LIT_SCHOOL had on many writers of the period. LIT_THESIS .
LIT_A_TWO	Still, while scholars often feel LIT_BOOK is LIT_ADJ_NEG , it is one of LASTNAME 's LIT_SUPER_POS works. LIT_THESIS .
LIT_A_TWO	Nevertheless, LASTNAME 's use of LIT_THEMES is all too often mistaken for LIT_THEMES in LIT_BOOK . LIT_THESIS .
LIT_A_TWO	To wit, LIT_THEMES was never so present in FIRSTNAME LASTNAME 's work as in the LIT_ADJ_POS novel, LIT_BOOK .  LIT_THESIS .
LIT_A_TWO	Unfortunately, LIT_BOOK is absolutely LIT_ADJ_NEG in terms of LASTNAME 's usual LIT_MOVEMENTA politics . LIT_THESIS .
LIT_THESIS	LIT_THESIS_OPENING , LIT_THESIS_MIDDLE LIT_THESIS_CLOSE
LIT_THESIS_OPENING	In this paper
LIT_THESIS_OPENING	In the following paragraphs
LIT_THESIS_OPENING	Below
LIT_THESIS_MIDDLE	I will show that
LIT_THESIS_MIDDLE	evidence will be presented that clearly demonstrates
LIT_THESIS_MIDDLE	it will be proven that
LIT_THESIS_CLOSE	most LIT_MOVEMENTA critics are wrong about LASTNAME 's use of LIT_THEMES 
LIT_THESIS_CLOSE	LIT_BOOK is the most LIT_ADJ_POS example of LIT_MOVEMENTA writing ever created 
LIT_THESIS_CLOSE	LIT_BOOK 's LIT_MOVEMENTA overtones and views on LIT_BIG_NOUN are <i>not</i> evidence of LASTNAME 's surrender to LIT_BIG_NOUN 
LIT_THESIS_CLOSE	LASTNAME 's LIT_ADJ_POS writing is representative of the strong LIT_MOVEMENTA ideals of the author's time
LIT_A_THREE	Support for this claim is present in the following: (a) LIT_A_THESIS_POINT_A , (b) LIT_A_THESIS_POINT_B , and (c) LIT_A_THESIS_POINT_C .
LIT_A_THREE	This claim is buttressed by three points: (1) LIT_A_THESIS_POINT_B , (2) LIT_A_THESIS_POINT_A , and (3) LIT_A_THESIS_POINT_C .
LIT_A_THESIS_POINT_A	 LASTNAME 's LIT_ADJ_POS LIT_ACTION of LIT_THEMES_A in the work
LIT_A_THESIS_POINT_A	 LASTNAME 's LIT_ADJ_NEG take on LIT_THEMES_A throughout the book
LIT_A_THESIS_POINT_A	 LASTNAME 's adversarial relationship to LIT_SCHOOL while writing the book
LIT_A_THESIS_POINT_A	 LASTNAME 's LIT_ADJ_POS role in LIT_SCHOOL
LIT_A_THESIS_POINT_B	the LIT_ADJ_POS use of LIT_THEMES_B in LIT_BOOK
LIT_A_THESIS_POINT_B	the LIT_MOVEMENTA theme of LIT_THEMES_B in LIT_BOOK

LIT_B_ONE	in the LIT_CHAPTER_EARLY of LIT_BOOK , LASTNAME writes: LIT_QUOTE LIT_QUOTE_COMMENT
LIT_B_ONE	the lingering line of LIT_BOOK is , LIT_QUOTE LIT_QUOTE_COMMENT 
LIT_B_ONE	consider this passage: LIT_QUOTE LIT_QUOTE_COMMENT 
LIT_B_ONE	in LIT_BOOK 's LIT_CHAPTER_EARLY we find LASTNAME at his LIT_SUPER_NEG . But even this section can still prove LIT_CRIT_ADJ to the LIT_GROUP reader . Consider: LIT_QUOTE LIT_QUOTE_COMMENT 
LIT_B_ONE	with words like \" LIT_QUOTEA ,\"  LASTNAME stakes his claim.
LIT_B_ONE	lines like \" LIT_QUOTEA ,\" have made LIT_BOOK required reading for the LIT_MOVEMENTA student. 
LIT_B_ONE	LASTNAME 's LIT_GROUP sympathies are evident in LIT_BOOK . 
LIT_B_ONE	how LIT_ADJ_RHET that LIT_BOOK is LIT_DURATION dismissed as little more than LIT_TYPE !
LIT_B_ONE	LIT_BOOK is LIT_ADV a LIT_ADJ_POS work.
LIT_B_ONE	when LIT_PEOPLE dismiss LIT_BOOK as a simple LIT_TYPE , all I can say is, LIT_FILLER 
LIT_B_ONE	LIT_BOOK is LIT_CRIT_ADJ ground for the LIT_MOVEMENTA LIT_GROUP .
LIT_B_ONE	could the so-called  \" LIT_MOVEMENTA \" critics be more wrong about LIT_BOOK ?
LIT_B_ONE	LASTNAME 's prose is so LIT_DURATION LIT_ADJ_POS that we often take for granted lines like LIT_QUOTE 
LIT_B_ONE	what ignorant moron annointed LASTNAME as the LIT_MOVEMENTA savior?
LIT_B_ONE	these themes are most evident in LIT_CHAPTER_EARLY of LIT_BOOK , for that is when LASTNAME 's often LIT_ADJ_NEG prose shines most brightly.
LIT_B_ONE	LASTNAME 's LIT_ACTION of such imagery is most skillful in LIT_BOOK 's LIT_ADJ_POS LIT_CHAPTER_EARLY .
LIT_B_ONE	the LIT_THEMES_A in LIT_BOOK really hits you like a rock.
LIT_B_ONE	LIT_THEMES_A is not LIT_BOOK 's only theme; there is also pure LIT_BIG_NOUN .
LIT_B_ONE	consider that LIT_BOOK was not so much written by LASTNAME as belched forth in a fit of sublime inspiration .
LIT_B_ONE	realize that LASTNAME had lost his LIT_NOUN_POS just before completing LIT_BOOK .
LIT_B_ONE	LASTNAME 's LIT_NOUN_POS is truly evident in LIT_BOOK .
LIT_B_ONE	critics are dead wrong when they cite LIT_BOOK as an example of LASTNAME 's dwindling LIT_NOUN_POS .
LIT_B_ONE	any examination of LIT_BIG_NOUN is incomplete without addressing the LIT_THEMES_A of LIT_BOOK .
LIT_B_ONE	LIT_BOOK is, like all of LASTNAME 's great works, LIT_PHRASE .
LIT_B_ONE	LIT_BOOK cannot be fully understood without examination of LIT_SCHOOL .
LIT_B_ONE	the LIT_THEMES motif in LIT_BOOK was not original with LASTNAME . Consider this famous quote by LIT_SOURCE : \" LIT_QUOTEA .\" LIT_QUOTE_COMMENT 
LIT_B_ONE	The protagonist's life is dominated by LIT_NOUN , and the character of LIT_CHARACTER is LIT_ADJ as a symbol of LIT_THEMES_A .
LIT_B_TWO	In the LIT_CHAPTER_LATE the reader is presented with a paradox: though the characters seem unable to escape LIT_THEMES , they are simultaneously LIT_ADJ and LIT_ADJ .
LIT_B_TWO	the author uses LIT_THEMES_B to transform LIT_CHARACTER from a LIT_ADJ_NEG bit-player into a LIT_ADJ_POS hero.
LIT_B_TWO	To indicate that LIT_CHARACTER is the work's villain, the author makes his dialogue LIT_ADJ_NEG .
LIT_B_TWO	LIT_BOOK 's LIT_ACTION of LIT_THEMES_C is in keeping with its LIT_MOVEMENTA point-of-view .
LIT_B_TWO	it's quite obvious that LASTNAME 's LIT_NOUN_POS was tenuous at best by the time LIT_BOOK was completed.
LIT_B_TWO	LIT_BOOK is not so much LIT_TYPE <i>per se</i> as it is LASTNAME 's most heart-felt LIT_TITLE_NOUN of LIT_BIG_NOUN .
LIT_B_TWO	for the LIT_GROUP community there can be no other conclusion.
LIT_B_TWO	while this fact allays most of LASTNAME 's LIT_GROUP detractors, it has led a certain LIT_MOVEMENTA critic-- the execrable LIT_SOURCE --to proclaim \" LIT_QUOTE_COMMENT \"
LIT_B_TWO	it should be obvious that LASTNAME was never driven <i>purely</i> by the LIT_BIG_NOUN paradigm.
LIT_B_TWO	of course, like all great works, LIT_BOOK has its flaws!
LIT_B_TWO	still, LIT_BOOK was not originally seen as a <i>tour de force</i> by the intelligensia. LIT_FILLER 
LIT_B_TWO	As such, the words of the character LIT_CHARACTER ring true: \" LIT_QUOTEA .\"
LIT_B_TWO	as you can imagine, LIT_PEOPLE took to the streets after the book's first publication.
LIT_B_TWO	wars have been fought over less.
LIT_B_TWO	many LIT_PEOPLE_MOD see the book's LIT_CHAPTER_LATE as the LIT_SUPER_POS ; I, however, do not.
LIT_B_TWO	LASTNAME 's quest for LIT_BIG_NOUN in his later books supports this conclusion.
LIT_B_TWO	While most other HIST_NATIONALITY authors conceived of their characters as LIT_MOVEMENT symbols, LASTNAME 's lusted for real LIT_BIG_NOUN ! 
LIT_B_TWO	Where many other HIST_NATIONALITY writers failed to convincingly portray LIT_THEMES , LASTNAME succeeds.
LIT_B_CONCLUDE	LIT_B_THREE_UNPUNC ; LIT_B_THREE 
LIT_B_CONCLUDE	 LIT_B_THREE 
LIT_B_THREE	critics of LASTNAME 's work often overlook this aspect.
LIT_B_THREE	LIT_CHARACTER 's famously LIT_ADJ_NEG attitude throughout the book is often cited.
LIT_B_THREE	parts of the book's LIT_CHAPTER_LATE are often cited as evidence.
LIT_B_THREE	it is no great feat to realize LASTNAME has written himself into a corner here!
LIT_B_THREE	LIT_ADV , LASTNAME meant this as a critique of LIT_THEMES_C .
LIT_B_THREE	of course, this is the LIT_MOVEMENTA view.
LIT_B_THREE	of course, this is only a guess.
LIT_B_THREE	nonetheless, we must be careful in making assumptions.
LIT_B_THREE	as pure LIT_TYPE , LIT_BOOK was assailed for such statements. LIT_FILLER 
LIT_B_THREE	read as LIT_TYPE , LIT_BOOK supports no other analysis.
LIT_B_THREE	that's the LIT_GROUP assumption, at least.
LIT_B_THREE	at best, this is the LIT_ADJ_NEG critique. LIT_FILLER 
LIT_B_THREE	some of LASTNAME 's LIT_SUPER_POS writing is in LIT_BOOK .
LIT_B_THREE	to see how this supports my previous claim is quite trivial.
LIT_B_THREE	evidence for this conclusion abounds in the LIT_CHAPTER_LATE of the book.
LIT_B_THREE	this all but proves my thesis, especially when LASTNAME 's LIT_ACTION of LIT_THEMES_A in the book is taken into account.
LIT_B_THREE	the casual critic LIT_DURATION misses this point.
LIT_B_THREE	LASTNAME 's point here is clear:  LIT_BIG_NOUN and LIT_BIG_NOUN are LIT_STOCK_PHRASE .
LIT_B_THREE	as an affirmation of LIT_BIG_NOUN , this is LASTNAME 's grandest statement.
LIT_B_THREE	it is also LIT_ADJ_RHET that scholars--by seeing him as an avatar of LASTNAME 's LIT_MOVEMENT views--have misinterpreted the character LIT_CHARACTER 's role in the book.
LIT_B_THREE	this becomes LIT_ADJ_RHET only when one considers the book's famous line, LIT_QUOTE 
LIT_B_THREE	LIT_CHARACTER is a surprisingly LIT_ADJ character.
LIT_B_THREE	this is LIT_ADV why LIT_CHARACTER is such a LIT_ADJ character.
LIT_B_THREE	LIT_CHARACTER is a far from marginal character; in fact, it is through him that many of LASTNAME 's LIT_PERIOD influences show through.
LIT_B_THREE	this reasoning differs radically from traditional theories of LIT_SCHOOL .
LIT_B_THREE_UNPUNC	Critics of LASTNAME 's work often overlook this aspect
LIT_B_THREE_UNPUNC	LIT_CHARACTER 's famously LIT_ADJ_NEG attitude throughout the book is often blamed
LIT_B_THREE_UNPUNC	developments in the LIT_CHAPTER_EARLY are often cited as evidence
LIT_B_THREE_UNPUNC	It is no great feat to realize LASTNAME has written himself into a corner here
LIT_B_THREE_UNPUNC	LIT_ADV , LASTNAME meant this as a critique of LIT_THEMES_C

LIT_B_THREE_UNPUNC	This becomes LIT_ADJ_RHET only when one considers the book's famous line, \" LIT_QUOTEA \" 
LIT_B_THREE_UNPUNC	LIT_CHARACTER is a LIT_ADJ character for this very reason
LIT_B_THREE_UNPUNC	This is LIT_ADV why LIT_CHARACTER is such a LIT_ADJ character
LIT_B_THREE_UNPUNC	LIT_CHARACTER is a far from marginal character; in fact, it is through him that many of LASTNAME 's LIT_PERIOD influences show through

LIT_C_ONE_CLOSING	LIT_BIG_NOUN is more deftly LIT_ACTION in LIT_BOOK than ever before.
LIT_C_ONE_CLOSING	LIT_BOOK should be required reading for all LIT_PEOPLE_MOD .
LIT_C_ONE_CLOSING	LIT_BOOK is truly LASTNAME 's most enduring contribution to mankind's continuing attempt to understand his own LIT_BIG_NOUN .
LIT_C_ONE_CLOSING	as a testament to LIT_BIG_NOUN and a celebration of LIT_BIG_NOUN , LIT_BOOK will always ring true.
LIT_C_ONE_CLOSING	LASTNAME 's LIT_BOOK will always be with me.
LIT_C_ONE_CLOSING	LIT_BOOK remains the most important LIT_ACTION of LIT_BIG_NOUN ever committed to paper.
LIT_C_ONE_CLOSING	LIT_BOOK might never be fully appreciated.
LIT_C_ONE_CLOSING	the echoes of LIT_BOOK will reverberate through the centuries, for years to come.
LIT_C_ONE_CLOSING	the sun may never set on the empire that is LIT_BOOK 's lasting influence.
LIT_C_ONE_CLOSING	the influence of LIT_BOOK is stronger than ever.
LIT_C_ONE_CLOSING	the influence of LASTNAME 's LIT_BOOK is still strong.
LIT_C_ONE_CLOSING	it's easy to forget that LIT_BOOK was the most HIST_ADJ work of its time.
LIT_C_TWO	While other works influenced by LIT_SCHOOL are LIT_DURATION forgotten , LIT_BOOK remains LIT_ADJ_POS .
LIT_C_TWO	Perhaps it's time that scholars reevaluated their estimation of the book .
LIT_C_THREE	Though contemporaries found LASTNAME 's use of LIT_THEMES LIT_ADJ_NEG , history will vindicate LIT_BOOK .
LIT_C_THREE	Though famous for portrayals of LIT_THEMES_A in other works, LASTNAME will always be loved for his LIT_ADJ_POS LIT_ACTION of LIT_THEMES_B in this book.
LIT_C_FOUR	This work is a fine example of what I like to call LIT_TYPE .
LIT_C_FOUR	The Great Muse certainly smiled on LASTNAME when LIT_BOOK was written.
LIT_C_FOUR	This book is perhaps the greatest LIT_ACTION of LIT_BIG_NOUN mankind has ever seen.
LIT_C_FOUR	Join me in appreciating it .
LIT_C_FOUR	FIRSTNAME LASTNAME , we salute you.
LIT_C_FOUR	God rest ye, FIRSTNAME LASTNAME .
LIT_C_FOUR	All thanks to a person I like to call FIRSTNAME LASTNAME .
LIT_C_FOUR	FIRSTNAME LASTNAME : one soul lost in a LIT_ADJ_NEG whirlwind of LIT_NOUN .
LIT_C_FOUR	This concludes my research.
LIT_C_FOUR	Thus concludes my participation in this class.

SCI_A_ONE	Many SCI_PEOPLE would agree that, had it not been for TOPIC , the SCI_ACT might never have occurred.
SCI_A_ONE	Without TOPIC , the SCI_YEAR SCI_ACT would have been merely a SCI_ADJ fantasy.
SCI_A_ONE	The implications of TOPIC technology have been far-reaching and pervasive, touching all aspects of our lives.
SCI_A_ONE	Although the SCI_ACT by SCI_SOURCE and the SCI_ACT by SCI_SOURCE were both SCI_ADJ discoveries, they would have been nothing without TOPIC .
SCI_A_ONE	Our SCI_ADJ_ADV modern lives are influenced by TOPIC everyday.
SCI_A_ONE	TOPIC technology has led to SCI_ADJ advances in SCI_FIELD , discoveries that today we take for granted.
SCI_A_ONE	Unified TOPIC theory has led to many SCI_ADJ advances, including SCI_THING and SCI_THING .
SCI_A_TWO	Few scientists have been as SCI_ADJ as SCI_SCIENTIST in the development of TOPIC .
SCI_A_TWO	No discussion of TOPIC would be complete without mention of SCI_SCIENTIST .
SCI_A_TWO	Although the contributions of SCI_SOURCE and SCI_SOURCE to TOPIC are well documented, few people realize that it was actually SCI_SCIENTIST who played a leading role in its development.
SCI_A_TWO	Few would argue that SCI_SCIENTIST 's discovery of TOPIC was one of the most important scientific advances of our century.
SCI_A_TWO	No one played as pivotal a role in the development of TOPIC as SCI_SCIENTIST .
SCI_A_TWO	Although the contributions of SCI_SCIENTIST to the worldwide advancement of science are SCI_ADJ , TOPIC is perhaps the most SCI_ADJ of all.
SCI_A_TWO	TOPIC , perhaps one of the most SCI_ADJ advances of our time, would never have occurred had it not been for SCI_SCIENTIST .
SCI_A_THREE	Three points support this thesis: SCI_A_FACT , SCI_A_FACT , and most importantly, SCI_A_FACT .
SCI_A_THREE	Three important discoveries led to the discovery of TOPIC : SCI_THING , SCI_THING , and SCI_THING .
SCI_A_THREE	The evidence points to three main factors: SCI_A_FACT , SCI_THING , and SCI_A_FACT .
SCI_A_FOUR	In this paper, the author will demonstrate the important role played by SCI_SCIENTIST in the development of TOPIC .
SCI_A_FOUR	The author hopes to set the record straight concerning SCI_SCIENTIST 's many contributions to TOPIC .
SCI_A_FOUR	This paper will explore SCI_SCIENTIST 's important relationship with TOPIC .

SCI_B_LEADIN_A	First, 
SCI_B_LEADIN_A	Primarily, 
SCI_B_LEADIN_A	For starters, 
SCI_B_LEADIN	But, 
SCI_B_LEADIN	In addition, 
SCI_B_LEADIN	SCI_ADJ_ADV enough, 
SCI_B_LEADIN	Without a doubt, 
SCI_B_LEADIN	In the opinion of SCI_SOURCE , 
SCI_B_LEADIN	Predictably, 
SCI_B_LEADIN	On a smilar note, 
SCI_B_LEADIN	Furthermore, 
SCI_B_LEADIN	By comparison, 
SCI_B_LEADIN	In the opinions of many, 
SCI_B_LEADIN	Certainly, 
SCI_B_LEADIN	In SCI_YEAR , 
SCI_B_LEADIN_C	Finally, 
SCI_B_LEADIN_C	Ultimately, 
SCI_B_LEADIN_C	As a result, 
SCI_B_LEADIN_C	In the end, 
SCI_B_ONE	LASTNAME 's SCI_ADJ discovery of SCI_THING prompted SCI_ADJ inquiry into TOPIC .
SCI_B_ONE	LASTNAME 's initial intent was not so much SCI_ACT , but rather SCI_ACT .
SCI_B_ONE	LASTNAME 's SCI_ADJ discovery of TOPIC was no so much SCI_COMPLEXNOUN as it was SCI_COMPLEXNOUN .
SCI_B_ONE	few would have suspected that LASTNAME 's SCI_ADJ experiments with SCI_THING would lead to TOPIC .
SCI_B_ONE	the idea of TOPIC was a SCI_ADJ joke.
SCI_B_ONE	few scientists in SCI_YEAR were willing to risk their SCI_ADJ reputations on controversial TOPIC research.
SCI_B_ONE	LASTNAME 's interest in TOPIC sprung from a personal, SCI_ADJ sense of duty.
SCI_B_TWO	public interest was piqued by the SCI_ADJ possibility of using TOPIC warfare against the SCI_COUNTRY enemy.
SCI_B_TWO	facing the SCI_ADJ attitudes of the scientific community, LASTNAME continued reasearch into TOPIC .
SCI_B_TWO	it wasn't until the SCI_ADJ SCI_ACT in SCI_YEAR that TOPIC research became a possibility.
SCI_B_TWO	no one before LASTNAME had considered combining the SCI_YEAR findings of SCI_SOURCE , who had SCI_VERBED SCI_THING before anyone thought it possible, with TOPIC in such a meaningful way.
SCI_B_TWO	LASTNAME made a SCI_ADJ discovery: TOPIC , it would seem, had SCI_MOVEMENT implications.  This realization was on a par with the SCI_ACT .
SCI_B_TWO	SCI_ADJ success came in SCI_YEAR , when lastname SCI_ACH .
SCI_B_TWO	it was a long, SCI_ADJ time for LASTNAME .
SCI_B_TWO	SCI_SOURCE summed up scientific sentiment in saying, SCI_QUOTE 
SCI_B_THREE	LASTNAME contrinued working despite SCI_ADJ obstacles.
SCI_B_THREE	SCI_SOURCE 's SCI_YEAR paper on SCI_THING provided a SCI_ADJ basis for SCI_COMPLEXNOUN .
SCI_B_THREE	LASTNAME 's TOPIC research soon attracted the government, who were interested in military applications, namely the SCI_ACT .
SCI_B_THREE	it wasn't until the SCI_COUNTRY SCI_PEOPLE SCI_ACH that LASTNAME gained insight into the SCI_COMPLEXNOUN of TOPIC .
SCI_B_THREE	the SCI_ADJ importance of TOPIC was not fully grasped until LASTNAME SCI_ACH in SCI_YEAR .
SCI_B_THREE	LASTNAME 's SCI_ADJ efforts had begun to prove SCI_ADJ .
SCI_B_THREE	LASTNAME became increasingly intrigued by the SCI_ADJ SCI_COMPLEXNOUN of SCI_ACH_PRES .
SCI_B_THREE	LASTNAME is rumored to have said, SCI_QUOTE 
SCI_B_SUPP_ONE	SCI_ADJ developments seemed SCI_ADJ in the wake of recent SCI_COUNTRY TOPIC discoveries.
SCI_B_SUPP_ONE	dismay became relief when LASTNAME succeeded in SCI_ACH_PRES .
SCI_B_SUPP_ONE	further investigation into SCI_THING proved SCI_ADJ .  TOPIC was suggested as a SCI_ADJ alternative.
SCI_B_SUPP_ONE	LASTNAME remained SCI_ADJ_ADV undaunted, claiming SCI_QUOTE 
SCI_B_SUPP_ONE	LASTNAME 's SCI_ADJ thesis was supported by SCI_ADJ SCI_COUNTRY research.
SCI_B_SUPP_ONE	the question of TOPIC 's SCI_ADJ SCI_COMPLEXNOUN still remained to be answered, at least until the SCI_ACT .
SCI_B_SUPP_ONE	LASTNAME 's research posed a SCI_ADJ question: what, indeed was the SCI_COMPLEXNOUN of TOPIC ?
SCI_B_SUPP_TWO	Working closely with the SCI_COUNTRY SCI_PERSON SCI_SOURCE , LASTNAME struggled to define a Unified Theory of TOPIC .
SCI_B_SUPP_TWO	SCI_SOURCE 's SCI_ADJ research into SCI_THING provided a SCI_ADJ touchstone for LASTNAME .
SCI_B_SUPP_TWO	TOPIC 's SCI_ADJ possibilities had never been SCI_VERBED until LASTNAME suggested SCI_ACH_PRES .
SCI_B_SUPP_TWO	LASTNAME 's theory of TOPIC was SCI_ADJ_ADV complete, but futher study still seemed SCI_ADJ if the SCI_ACT was to occur.
SCI_B_SUPP_TWO	LASTNAME was SCI_ADJ_ADV close to a discovery.
SCI_B_SUPP_TWO	LASTNAME had grasped the SCI_COMPLEXNOUN of TOPIC ; but its SCI_COMPLEXNOUN was still SCI_ADJ_ADV out of reach.
SCI_B_SUPP_TWO	LASTNAME hoped that TOPIC technology might become a SCI_ADJ force for good.
SCI_B_SUPP_THREE	As SCI_SOURCE said of the discovery, SCI_QUOTE 
SCI_B_SUPP_THREE	As SCI_SOURCE once quipped, SCI_QUOTE 
SCI_B_SUPP_THREE	This begs the question: is TOPIC SCI_MOVEMENT in nature?  LASTNAME would say SCI_RESPONSE .
SCI_B_SUPP_THREE	LASTNAME 's SCI_ADJ paper was published later that year.
SCI_B_SUPP_THREE	LASTNAME felt the time was ripe for further exploration, possibly even the SCI_ACT_A SCI_THING .
SCI_B_SUPP_THREE	LASTNAME 's colleagues in SCI_FIELD were intrigued.

SCI_C_ONE_CLOSING	the lessons of TOPIC seem outdated and irrelevant.
SCI_C_ONE_CLOSING	the survivors of TOPIC warfare are growing fewer by the day.
SCI_C_TWO	It's easy to forget that, once, TOPIC was a SCI_ADJ mystery that challenged even the greatest SCI_COUNTRY SCI_PEOPLE .
SCI_C_TWO	But, in reality, the lessons of TOPIC are more relevant than ever.
SCI_C_THREE	Even as late as SCI_YEAR , SCI_SOURCE noted , SCI_QUOTE

HIST_SUBTITLE	COMPLEXNOUN and COMPLEXNOUN
HIST_A1	Many HIST_SCHOLARS agree that TOPIC is HIST_ADV the most HIST_ADJ event in HIST_NATIONALITY history.
HIST_A1	TOPIC was a HIST_ADJ turning-point in HIST_NATIONALITY history.
HIST_A1	TOPIC is perhaps the most misunderstood point in HIST_NATIONALITY history.
HIST_A1	When studying TOPIC , it is HIST_ADJ to consider the HIST_NATIONALITY perspective on this significant event.
HIST_A1	HIST_QUOTE As HIST_SOURCE said in HIST_YEAR , TOPIC was certainly a HIST_ADJ time full of COMPLEXNOUN and COMPLEXNOUN .
HIST_A1	In HIST_YEAR , HIST_SOURCE had this to say about TOPIC :  HIST_QUOTE
HIST_A1	Perhaps HIST_SOURCE best summed up the HIST_NATIONALITY sentiment toward TOPIC when he said, HIST_QUOTE
HIST_A2	HIST_TRANS it is HIST_ADJ to see that TOPIC was in fact a product of the HIST_MOVEMENT movement and its HIST_NATIONALITY followers.
HIST_A2	HIST_TRANS it became obvious that TOPIC was not nearly as HIST_ADJ as HIST_NATIONALITY  HIST_SCHOLARS would have us believe.
HIST_A2	HIST_TRANS we now know that TOPIC was actually a HIST_ADJ conspiracy by the HIST_NATIONALITY  HIST_PEOPLE in their attempt to distract its citizens from the COMPLEXNOUN of the HIST_MOVEMENT movement.
HIST_A2	While HIST_ADJ HIST_SCHOLARS have called this event HIST_ADJ , I would argue that TOPIC was in fact HIST_ADJ .
HIST_TRANS	Although it was not clear in HIST_YEAR , 
HIST_TRANS	While other HIST_ADJ HIST_SCHOLARS may disagree, 
HIST_TRANS	But after examining the HIST_ADJ evidence, 
HIST_A3	HIST_ANALYSIS : HIST_FACT , HIST_FACT , and HIST_FACT .
HIST_ANALYSIS	This claim is supported by three HIST_ADJ facts
HIST_ANALYSIS	This claim is confirmed by three HIST_ADJ points
HIST_FACT	the HIST_NATIONALITY HIST_ACT of HIST_YEAR
HIST_FACT	the HIST_NATIONALITY HIST_ACT of HIST_YEAR that HIST_EFFECT
HIST_FACT	the HIST_SOURCE HIST_ACT of HIST_YEAR
HIST_FACT	the HIST_SOURCE HIST_ACT of HIST_YEAR that HIST_EFFECT
HIST_FACT	the HIST_MOVEMENT manifesto written by HIST_SOURCE
HIST_FACT	the COMPLEXNOUN present in the HIST_ACT of HIST_YEAR
HIST_FACT	the HIST_NATIONALITY literature of the HIST_MOVEMENT period
HIST_B1	it's important to take into account a HIST_ADJ quote by HIST_SOURCE : HIST_QUOTE HIST_QUOTE_COMMENT
HIST_B1	let us not forget HIST_SOURCE 's feelings on the subject: HIST_QUOTE HIST_QUOTE_COMMENT
HIST_B1	any examination of TOPIC would be incomplete without HIST_SOURCE : HIST_QUOTE HIST_QUOTE_COMMENT
HIST_B1	the HIST_NATIONALITY HIST_ACT of HIST_YEAR had a HIST_ADJ role in TOPIC because, as HIST_SOURCE said, HIST_QUOTE HIST_QUOTE_COMMENT
HIST_B1	in HIST_YEAR a member of a HIST_ADJ group of HIST_NATIONALITY HIST_SCHOLARS wrote: HIST_QUOTE HIST_QUOTE_COMMENT
HIST_B1	HIST_FACT was HIST_ADJ in TOPIC compared to HIST_FACT .
HIST_B1	HIST_FACT was a HIST_ADJ event that almost rivaled TOPIC in terms of its COMPLEXNOUN .
HIST_B1	TOPIC cannot be truly understood without examination of HIST_FACT .
HIST_B2	When we examine HIST_FACT , what is most HIST_ADJ is its COMPLEXNOUN and how that relates to TOPIC .
HIST_B2	Even HIST_SOURCE agrees that HIST_FACT was a direct cause of TOPIC . In HIST_YEAR he said HIST_QUOTE
HIST_B2	The HIST_ADJ reality is that HIST_FACT was caused by TOPIC , a fact well documented by HIST_SOURCE .
HIST_B2	HIST_SOURCE , in spite of his HIST_NATIONALITY allegiances, believed that HIST_FACT and TOPIC were in fact symptoms of the same HIST_MOVEMENT unrest among the HIST_PEOPLE .
HIST_B2	This begs the question, was TOPIC HIST_MOVEMENT ? In HIST_YEAR it was thought that HIST_QUOTE
HIST_B2	Without the HIST_MOVEMENT HIST_ACT it is unlikely that TOPIC would ever have come to fruition.
HIST_B2	Without TOPIC it is unlikely that the HIST_MOVEMENT HIST_ACT would ever have occurred.
HIST_B2	Without TOPIC it is unlikely that the HIST_NATIONALITY HIST_ACT of HIST_YEAR would have been successful.
HIST_B3	HIST_ADV HIST_SCHOLARS recognize that the two are intertwined.
HIST_B3	If HIST_FACT was a HIST_MOVEMENT plot, then obviously TOPIC must have been as well.
HIST_B3	While HIST_SOURCE believed that TOPIC was caused by the HIST_PEOPLE , this HIST_ADJ evidence points instead to the HIST_PEOPLE .
HIST_B3	Though TOPIC may have been HIST_MOVEMENT , this HIST_ADJ fact was never accepted by the HIST_NATIONALITY HIST_PEOPLE .
HIST_B3	In the opinion of HIST_SOURCE , nothing could ever be as HIST_ADJ as TOPIC .
HIST_B3	HIST_ADV the COMPLEXNOUN in HIST_FACT has been grossly misinterpreted by HIST_SCHOLARS .
HIST_B3	HIST_ADV the role of HIST_MOVEMENT HIST_SCHOLARS in TOPIC has been overrated.
HIST_B3	HIST_ADV HIST_SCHOLARS have marginalized the part of HIST_MOVEMENT in TOPIC .

HIST_C1	HIST_OPENING the days of TOPIC are long over.
HIST_C1	HIST_OPENING we've come a long way since TOPIC .
HIST_C1	HIST_OPENING our memories of TOPIC have become faded.
HIST_C1	HIST_OPENING the influence of TOPIC has waned.
HIST_C1	HIST_OPENING the lessons of TOPIC seem outdated and irrelevant.
HIST_C1	HIST_OPENING the survivors of TOPIC are growing fewer by the day.
HIST_C2	It's easy to forget that, once, TOPIC was a HIST_ADJ force that changed the minds and hearts of the HIST_NATIONALITY HIST_PEOPLE .
HIST_C2	But, in reality, the lessons of TOPIC are more relevant than ever.
HIST_C3	Even as late as HIST_YEAR , HIST_SOURCE noted , HIST_QUOTE
HIST_C3	As prominent HIST_SCHOLARS like HIST_SOURCE have noted, HIST_QUOTE
HIST_C4	The world was changing. Changing, with the help of TOPIC .
HIST_C4	HIST_ADV we are destined to never truly understand how much we owe to TOPIC .
HIST_C4	God bless America.

HIST_QUOTE_COMMENT	How true.
HIST_QUOTE_COMMENT	I could not agree more.
HIST_QUOTE_COMMENT	And how could one not agree?
HIST_QUOTE_COMMENT	In some circles, this caused revolution; in others, revulsion.
HIST_QUOTE_COMMENT	His opinion is HIST_ADJ not so much in its COMPLEXNOUN but in its HIST_ADJ use of COMPLEXNOUN to convey the HIST_MOVEMENT perspective on TOPIC .
HIST_QUOTE_COMMENT	His comment truly captures the view of the HIST_PEOPLE when confronted with TOPIC .
HIST_QUOTE_COMMENT	HIST_ADJ in this quote's COMPLEXNOUN is the HIST_MOVEMENT sentiment that swept over the HIST_NATIONALITY HIST_PEOPLE in HIST_YEAR .
HIST_QUOTE_COMMENT	His motive for saying this is HIST_ADJ when you consider that HIST_SOURCE was a HIST_MOVEMENT .
HIST_QUOTE_COMMENT	Immortal words from a HIST_ADJ player in the delicate balance that was TOPIC .
HIST_QUOTE_COMMENT	Though this was written during the HIST_NATIONALITY HIST_ACT of HIST_YEAR , it is already evident that HIST_MOVEMENT ideals had infiltrated the HIST_ADJ thoughts of HIST_SCHOLARS .
